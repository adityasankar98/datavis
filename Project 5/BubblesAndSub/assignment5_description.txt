What we created:
-For this assignment we decided to create a underwater SpongeBob themed animation. We created Patrick, SpongeBob, a submarine, bubbles, and an underwater scene. Each move/animate uniquely in their own way.

BEVO (Godson)

To create Bevo: 
	-Created a group for the Bevo
	-Created the PShapes by constructing vertices 
	-Created each part of Bevo separately (used different PShapes for each)
	-These PShapes became, "children" of the group
		-Ex: Body, Head, Tail
	-In the draw loop, used pushMatrix and popMatrix to manipulate the movements 	of the different shapes 


SUBMARINE and BUBBLES (Maria)

To create Smokey the Cannon: 
	-Created a group for the Cannon
	-Created the PShapes by constructing vertices 
	-Created each part of the Cannon separately (used different PShapes for each)
	-These PShapes became, "children" of the group
		-Ex: Barrel, Wheel, Axel
	-In the draw loop, used pushMatrix and popMatrix to manipulate the movements 	of the different shapes 
	-Barrel moves up and down 
	-Components of wheels rotate

FOOTBALL & FIELD (Ross)

To create the Football and Field: 
	-Created a group for the Football
	-Created the PShapes by constructing vertices 
	-Created each part of the Football separately (used different PShapes for 		each)
	-In the draw loop, used pushMatrix and popMatrix to manipulate the movements 	of the different shapes 
	-Football and the laces spiral
	-Also animated the background

CHALLENGES & CHANGES:
	-Moving things was a lot harder than we anticipated 
	-Changed some components of elements
