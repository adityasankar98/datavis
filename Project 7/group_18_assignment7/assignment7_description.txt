Ross Miglin (rdm2965), Godson Inikori (agi93) Maria Krychniak (mck959): Description File

What we created:
-For this assignment we decided to the card game of memory. Cards are flipped to try and find a match while a timer is going so it's important to have a good memory and be quick. You lose if you don't get the matches in time and you win if you clear all the cards (find the matches).

TIMER/BUTTONS/GAME RULES/BUG FIXING (Godson)

To create the TIMER/BUTTONS: 
	-Created the timer
	-Created a lot of the buttons that the user can interact with and the shapes
		â€”"S", "R", Spacebar, Mouse-click
	-Created the method of scoring 
	-Helped with match and cards

MATCH/GAME RULES/BUG FIXING (Maria)

To create MATCH: 
	-Created the function for when there are matches (cards disappear from the 		boards)
	-If not a match then the user continues guessing 
	-Added a hint function but then became to complicated and added a different 	button as a replacement ("S")

CARDS/GAME RULES/BUG FIXING (Ross)

To create the CARDS: 
	-Created a class for Cards
	-Created the visual for the cards 
	_Created how the cards were laid out on the screen 

CHALLENGES & CHANGES:
	-Took a lot to figure out how to even start and how to implement the rules
	-Had to be creative on how to make the simulation interactive 
	-Was much harder and more complicated than anticipated
